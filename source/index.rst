Welcome to OpSim developers handbook!
=====================================

The present document establishes specifications for the Open Source Process
Simulator (OpSim) project. The effort of development will be segmented
in three major areas related to corresponding aspects of the simulator:
the user interface, the engine and the data access.

This document is opened for insertions from our development community
and will be included in the code repository in RST format, in order that
concurrent modifications become feasible.
